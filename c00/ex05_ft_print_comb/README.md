# Exercise 05: ft_print_comb

### Create a function that displays all different combinations of three different digits in ascending order, listed by ascending order - yes, repetition is voluntary.

$>./a.out | cat -e
012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 023, ..., 789$>
```

- Allowed functions:

```
