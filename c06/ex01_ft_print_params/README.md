# Exercise 01: ft_print_params

### Create a program that displays its given arguments.
<br>

- Weâ€™re dealing with a program here, you should therefore have a function main in your .c file.

- One per line, in the same order as in the command line.

- It should display all arguments, except for argv[0].

- Example:
```
$>./a.out test1 test2 test3 | cat -e
test1$
test2$
test3$
$>
```

- Allowed functions:
```
write
```
